# Education Savings Account with Yield Farming

## Project Description
This project implements an Ethereum-based decentralized application (dApp) with the primary goal of offering an **Education Savings Account** for users, where they can deposit ETH and withdraw it as needed. Additionally, the platform incorporates a **Yield Farming Contract** that allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards based on their staked balance. The dApp interacts with three smart contracts: the **EducationSavingsAccount**, **YieldFarmingContract**, and **TokenContract**.
